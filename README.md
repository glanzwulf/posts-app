# Posts-App 📓

This is a [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) sample project built using the [Expo framework](https://expo.io).

### The app includes the following functionality:

✔️ It consumes this endpoint: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts and displays all posts with the userId and title fields

✔️ By clicking on a post you can see a detailed view with the content from the body field.

✔️ It utilizes the POST, PATCH & DELETE methods of the API

✔️ It is possible to filter all results by the field userId 

✔️ It is possible to refresh the list

✔️ It is possible to switch between a dark and light mode
